# Conf file Reader

This library is used to read configuration files in the format of key-value pairs.
The library supports reading from a file.

# Usage

To run a simple CLI using the library, you can use the following command:

```
cargo run -- -f <file_path>
```

There is simple test data file: `test_data/file_read_test.conf`, so the fastest way to test the library is to run the following command:

```
cargo run -- -f test_data/file_read_test.conf
```
